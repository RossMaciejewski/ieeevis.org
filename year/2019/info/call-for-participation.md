Call For Paper Submissions
        
IEEE VIS 2019 is the premier forum for advances in visualization for academia, government, and industry. 
This week-long event brings together researchers and practitioners with a shared interest in visualization. 
IEEE VIS 2019 is now soliciting novel research contributions and innovative applications in all areas of visualization 
as captured by its three main conference tracks:

[IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science & Technology (VAST):](../info/vast-paper-types)
Papers in VAST typically focus on problems that integrate data analysis algorithms and visual interfaces to support data analysis 
and analytical reasoning. 

*IEEE Conference on Information Visualization (InfoVis):*<br/>
Papers in InfoVis typically relate to the design or evaluation of new or improved visual encodings or interaction techniques 
of abstract data (such as graphs, tables, or text data).

*IEEE Conference on Scientific Visualization (SciVis):*<br />
Papers in SciVis typically relate to the design or evaluation of new or improved visual encodings or interaction techniques 
of data where the spatial layout is given by the dataset (such as scalar, vector and tensor fields).

*Which conference track should I submit to?*<br />
We encourage you to allocate your submission to one of the three tracks above. But if you are unsure, you will have the option 
to allow the paper chairs to allocate your paper to the one they deem the most appropriate.

*Where will papers appear?*<br />
Full papers accepted to IEEE InfoVis, SciVis, and most of VAST will appear in a special issue of the IEEE Transactions on 
Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). Some papers of the VAST conference will be published as archival, conference publications.

## Submission Dates
All deadlines are at 5:00pm Pacific Time (PDT).

* Abstract submission (MANDATORY)<br />
  Thursday, March 21, 2019
* Paper submission<br />
  Sunday, March 31, 2019
* Notification of results of first review cycle<br />
  Thursday, June 6, 2019
* Paper submission for second review cycle<br />
  Monday, June 24, 2019
* Final notification<br />
  Monday, July 8, 2019
* Camera-ready copy<br />
  Thursday, August 1, 2019

## Submission Guidelines
When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully read and adhere to the paper submission guidelines. 
Additionally, IEEE VIS 2019 will feature a separate, short papers track with a submission deadline of June XXX, 2019, after 
notifications for full papers have been sent out. You can find out more in the call for participation for IEEE VIS Short Papers.

## Reviewing Criteria
As the leading academic event on visualization research, IEEE VIS expects important, impactful, and potentially transformative 
contributions. Submissions will be judged on their importance, potential impact, degree to which the evidence supports the findings, 
appropriateness of methodology, and the research process followed. Papers and any supplemental material are only conditionally accepted 
and will undergo a full revision and review cycle after initial notification of review results. 
During this time, reviewers will ensure that necessary conditions for acceptance have been met in the new revision.

The three conference tracks at IEEE VIS 2019 use the same submission and review process. The conferences differ in the topics, 
emphasis, and approach, as described in the conference-specific information linked to above.
