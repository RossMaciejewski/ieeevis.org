**IEEE VIS 2020** is now soliciting novel research contributions and innovative applications in all areas of visualization 
as captured by its three main conference tracks:

[IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science & Technology (VAST)](vast-paper-types):<br />
Papers in VAST typically focus on problems that integrate data analysis algorithms and visual interfaces to support data 
analysis and analytical reasoning.

[IEEE Conference on Information Visualization (InfoVis)](infovis-paper-types):<br />
Papers in InfoVis typically relate to the design or evaluation of new or improved visual encodings or interaction techniques 
of abstract data such as graphs, tables, or text data, as well as models and theories of visualization.

[IEEE Conference on Scientific Visualization (SciVis)](scivis-paper-types):<br />
Papers in SciVis typically focus on new or improved visual encodings, mathematical models, algorithms, or interaction techniques for the visualization of data related to science and engineering, as well as integration into novel applications and systems.

*Where will papers appear?*<br />
Full papers accepted to IEEE InfoVis, SciVis, and most of VAST will appear in a special issue of the IEEE Transactions on 
Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). Some papers of the VAST conference will be published as archival, conference publications.

## Submission Guidelines and Reviewing Criteria
As the leading academic event on visualization research, IEEE VIS expects important, impactful, and potentially transformative 
contributions. Submissions will be judged on their importance, potential impact, degree to which the evidence supports the findings, 
appropriateness of methodology, and the research process followed. Papers and any supplemental material are only conditionally accepted 
and will undergo a full revision and review cycle after initial notification of review results. 
During this time, reviewers will ensure that necessary conditions for acceptance have been met in the new revision.

Additionally, IEEE VIS 2020 will feature a separate, short papers track with a submission deadline after notifications for full papers have been sent out. 
You can find out more in the call for participation for short papers on the IEEE VIS Website in the near future.
When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully read and adhere to the [paper submission guidelines](paper-submission-guidelines).

The three conference tracks at IEEE VIS 2020 use the same submission and review process. The conferences differ in the topics, 
emphasis, and approach, as described in the conference-specific for [VAST](vast-paper-types), [InfoVis](infovis-paper-types), and [SciVis](scivis-paper-types).

Authors of accepted papers should also follow the [instructions for preparing a camera-ready submission](/year/2020/info/presenter-information/final-information-paper-authors).

## Open Access Policy
Visualization research is better communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. Therefore, all paper authors are encouraged to share their accepted paper in an open access repository before the print deadline in accordance with IEEE copyright regulations. For instructions on how to post an accepted paper to an open access repository, please see the [VIS Open Practices Guidelines](/year/2020/info/open-practices/open-practices).
